I am a student on the Crick PhD program.
During my PhD, I will manipulate neurons in the visual cortex to understand how neural activity affects depth perception in virtual reality.

I obtained a B.A. Mod. in Biological and Biomedical Sciences, specialising in Neuroscience, from Trinity College Dublin in 2024.
As an undergraduate, and later a research assistant in the in the lab of Dr. Roisin McMackin, I used electroencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation to study alterations in neural activity in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
Before joining the Crick, I worked in the Oxford Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, where I supported researchers running magnetoencephalography and MRI-based experiments.
