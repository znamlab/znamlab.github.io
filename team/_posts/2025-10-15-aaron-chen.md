I am a Master's Student in the Znamenskiy lab. I did my undergraduate degree in University of Cambridge, and I am currently undertaking MSc Neuroscience program of UCL. 

I am interested in understanding the link between neuronal connectivity, functional properties and behaviors. Currently, I am working on optimizing connectivity mapping approaches originally developed by this lab. 

Outside of the lab, I like playing basketball, reading, metal and rap music, and hiking.
