I am a Summer Placement Student in the Znamenskiy lab working under the supervision of Benita.
As a current undergraduate student at The University of Hull studying BSc in Biomedical Science (Hons), Iâ€™m hoping to gain experience in a labratory environment to explore whether a PhD would be a suitable and enjoyable next step in my career
