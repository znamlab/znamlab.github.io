I am a laboratory research officer in the Znamenskiy lab.
 
I moved to London to for my bachelors to study Neuroscience at King’s College London and then continued to do an MRes at Imperial during which I got to work on three different projects. 
For one of these I joined the Znamenskiy lab and worked on testing the in situ sequencing gene panel on postnatal day 5 mice to identify any interesting gene candidates driving the establishment of cortico-cortical connectivity in development. 

I am now working on testing, optimising and preparing the fluidics and imaging system to be able to do automated in situ sequencing for our lab and the Crick.
