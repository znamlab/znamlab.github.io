I am a joint PhD student in the Specification and Function of Neural Circuits Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute and 
at the Synapse formation and autism laboratory at King's College London. 

I am interested in how neural circuits are specified during development. In my PhD I will probe the roles of molecular cues and activity-depenent mechanisms during development of long-range projections from the primary visual cortex to higher visual areas in mice.
