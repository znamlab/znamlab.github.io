I am a Group Leader at [the Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/)
and an Affiliate Member of [the Sainsbury Wellcome
Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/). I did my PhD with [Tony
Zador](http://zadorlab.labsites.cshl.edu/) at [CSHL](https://www.cshl.edu/) and
my postdoc with [Tom
Mrsic-Flogel](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/mrsic-flogel-lab) at
the [Biozentrum](https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/) at the University of Basel
and at [the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/)
at UCL.

My research programme is focused on the molecular mechanisms that contribute to
the functional and anatomical diversity of cortical neurons. The neocortex is
not tabula rasa but a product of tens of millions of years of evolution that have
shaped cortical circuits to perform computations essential for survival. These
evolutionary adaptations can be thought of as inductive biases that help animals
take advantage of the accumulated knowledge of their ancestors, passed down to
them in form of genetic instructions for wiring networks of neurons. Our mission
is to decypher these instructions by investigating how gene expression
programmes of cortical neurons constrain their synaptic wiring and understanding
the role of the resulting circuits in behavior.
