I am a first-year PhD student in the Znamenskiy Lab at the Crick. I am
interested in how neural circuits support important behavioural functions.
During my PhD, I will be studying how the visual cortex contributes to the
perception of depth in 3D space.

Prior to joining the Znamenskiy Lab, I completed my bachelor’s degree in Human
Sciences at UCL. Then I obtained my master’s degree in Neuroscience at the
University of Oxford, where I worked with Prof. Stephanie Cragg to study the
presynaptic mechanisms regulating striatal dopamine release, and with Prof.
David Dupret and Dr Helen Barron to study the circuit mechanisms underlying
memory recall.
