I am a first-year PhD student in the Znamenskiy Lab. My research will be focused on
developing new ways to study the connectivity and gene expression of large populations
of neurons in the visual cortex.

I completed my bachelor's degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University
of Bath, during which time I spent a placement year designing conditional protein interaction systems
in the labs of Dr. Peter Thorpe and Dr. Jean-Paul Vincent at the Francis Crick Institute.
After receiving my degree, I spent half a year in the lab of Prof. Tomoyuki Takahashi
at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, working on an all-optical electrophysiology
system for making rapid measurements of the activity of cultured neurons.
