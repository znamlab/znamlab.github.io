I am a postdoc in the Znamenskiy lab interested in understanding the relationship between the gene expression and neuronal activity in the visual cortex.

I earned my BA qualification in Molecular & Cell Biology with an Emphasis in Neurobiology from the University of California, Berkeley. I continued at Berkeley to complete a PhD in Molecular & Cell Biology studying gene expression changes underlying homeostatic plasticity mechanisms in Drosophila under the guidance of Prof. Ehud Isacoff.
