I am a postdoc at [the Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/)
with [Petr Znamenskiy](https://znamlab.org/). I did my PhD with [Matteo Carandini and Kenneth Harris](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cortexlab/) at UCL. 

My research aims to describe the connectivity and the computations through which sensory and motor systems interact during behaviour. I previously studied an audiovisual decision-making task, and at the Crick, I am investigating motion parallax.
